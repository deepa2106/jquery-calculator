Calculator

## Brief:
1. Git repo with Dev and Master branches
2. Me and Joe added as contributors
3. Finished README.md with brief, what went well, the challenges and list of what you delivered
4. pull-request submitted by 9:00am tomorrow
5. The calculator should display the correct value for each button pressed in the browser
6. when the equals button is pressed you should display the result of the last entered calculation
7. the program should use functions, loops, DOM selectors and DOM events

## What went well:
Making the functions for the calculations and saving the numbers into variables.

## What I found difficult:
Trying to get the numbers to display on the screen when clicked.
